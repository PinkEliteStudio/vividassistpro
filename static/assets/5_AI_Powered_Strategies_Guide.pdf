        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold vivid-pink">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-4">Are you a CEO working endless hours but feeling stuck? You’re not alone. Most high-performing CEOs lose 20+ hours a week on repetitive tasks, leaving little time to focus on growth. I’m Rhina Delgado, CEO of Vivid Assist Pro, and I’ve been there—hitting rock bottom, overwhelmed, and trying to control every problem like a game of whack-a-mole. My turning point came when I stopped the noise, shifted my mindset, and leaned on systems and faith to refocus. This guide uses persuasion questioning to help you uncover your real challenges and take the first steps to scale smarter.</p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold vivid-pink mt-4">Why This Guide?</h3>
        <p class="text-base mt-2">This guide is for CEOs who want to reclaim their time and grow without burnout. Using persuasion questioning, we’ll explore your current struggles, reveal hidden gaps, and share five simple strategies to save time and boost impact. Ready to stop spinning your wheels? Let’s dive in.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold vivid-pink">Stage 1: Connection Stage</h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-4"><strong class="italic">What’s keeping you up at night when you think about scaling your business?</strong></p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2">CEOs often feel trapped by endless tasks—meetings, emails, or hiring the wrong people. You might be wondering, <em>“Am I the only one who can’t keep up?”</em> You’re not. At Vivid Assist Pro, we help professionals like you streamline operations so you can focus on what matters—growth and results.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Actionable Tip</strong>: Take 5 minutes today to write down what frustrates you most about your daily grind. Is it scheduling? Paperwork? This clarity is your first step to change.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold vivid-pink">Stage 2: Engagement Stage (Situation Questions)</h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-4"><strong class="italic">What are you doing now to manage your time and grow your business?</strong></p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2">Let’s get specific. How many hours do you spend weekly on tasks like booking appointments, handling emails, or managing paperwork? For most CEOs, it’s 20-30 hours—time that could be spent strategizing or closing deals. How long have you been stuck in this cycle? What’s working, and what’s not?</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Example</strong>: How many hours do you spend sorting through emails or chasing unqualified candidates for a role? What systems are you using to delegate tasks? How often do you get pulled into low-priority issues because there’s no clear process?</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Actionable Tip</strong>: Track your time for one day using a free tool like Toggl. Categorize tasks into “high-impact” (e.g., strategy, sales) and “low-impact” (e.g., admin). You’ll see where your time leaks.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold vivid-pink">Stage 3: Problem Awareness Questions</h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-4"><strong class="italic">What’s the main reason you’re not getting the results you want?</strong></p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2">Let’s dig deeper. Are you spending hours on emails because there’s no system to filter them? Are you struggling to hire the right people because you lack a clear process? What’s causing you to feel overwhelmed or lose focus? How is this affecting your revenue or personal life?</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Clarifying Question</strong>: When you say you’re “too busy,” what exactly is taking up your time? Can you walk me through a typical day?</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Probing Question</strong>: Besides the obvious time crunch, what’s the biggest challenge preventing you from scaling to the next level?</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Pain Point</strong>: It’s not that your leads or tasks are the problem—it’s how you’re engaging with them. By asking the wrong questions or lacking systems, you’re missing opportunities. For example, spending 10 hours a week on unqualified candidates or manual accounting could be costing you $50,000+ annually in lost productivity.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Actionable Tip</strong>: Ask yourself, <em>“What’s one task I keep doing that someone else could handle?”</em> Write it down and commit to delegating it this week.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold vivid-pink">Stage 4: Solution Awareness Questions</h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-4"><strong class="italic">What would it look like if you could reclaim 10 hours a week and focus on growth?</strong></p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2">Imagine a future where repetitive tasks like scheduling or bookkeeping are automated, and you’re only working on high-impact activities like strategizing or building partnerships. How would that change your business? Your stress levels? What if AI tools could prioritize your emails or screen candidates automatically?</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Solution Question</strong>: If you could solve the problem of [manual emails or hiring inefficiencies], how would that impact your revenue? What would it do for you personally?</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Actionable Tip</strong>: Try a free AI tool like Calendly to streamline booking or HubSpot to automate email sorting. Start small to see the impact.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold vivid-pink">Stage 5: Consequence Questions</h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-4"><strong class="italic">What happens if you don’t address this now?</strong></p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2">If you keep losing time to repetitive tasks or asking the wrong questions in hiring or sales, what’s the cost? Could it mean missing million-dollar opportunities? Burnout? If nothing changes in the next 6 months, where will you be?</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Consequence Question</strong>: If you continue spending 20+ hours a week on tasks that don’t scale your business, what’s the risk to your revenue or goals?</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-2"><strong>Actionable Tip</strong>: Calculate the cost of inaction. For example, if you’re losing 10 hours weekly on manual tasks at a $500/hour value, that’s $260,000 a year. What could you achieve with that time back?</p>
